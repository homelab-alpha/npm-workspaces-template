# Contributing to this Project

Thanks for considering contributing to Homelab-Alpha! Your interest and effort
are invaluable to our community's growth and the enhancement of our project.
Below are some guidelines to streamline your contribution process:

## General Guidelines

### Communication

**Please Avoid Unnecessary Pings**

We kindly ask all contributors to refrain from pinging maintainers unless
absolutely necessary. Pings should be reserved for critical issues or urgent
matters that require immediate attention.

**Why**: Limiting pings to urgent matters helps maintainers focus on and
prioritize essential tasks more effectively.

### Code of Conduct

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, we adhere to a
[Code of Conduct]. Please read and respect it in all your interactions within
this project.

### Visual Aids

When reporting issues, asking for help, or proposing features, **screenshots**
and **screencasts (short videos)** can be incredibly helpful. They provide
visual context that text alone might miss, making it much easier for maintainers
to understand the problem or proposal.

- **Screenshots**: Use screenshots to capture specific UI elements, error
  messages, or visual states.
- **Screencasts**: For issues involving complex steps, animations, or transient
  behavior, a short screencast can be invaluable. Please ensure screencasts are
  concise and directly illustrate the point.

## Getting Started

### Discussions

Before opening a new issue, please check the [Discussions] section. This is the
best place to ask questions, share ideas, or discuss potential problems that
aren't clear-cut bugs. Engaging in discussions helps keep the issue tracker
focused on actionable tasks and can often provide quicker answers or solutions.

### Issues

- **Check Existing Issues**: Take a look at our list of [all issues] to see
  if someone is already working on the problem or feature you're interested in,
  or if it has already been addressed. If there's an open issue, consider
  contributing to it.
- **Creating New Issues**: If you're opening a new issue, ensure it's clear and
  concise. Provide detailed descriptions, including steps to reproduce any
  problems.
- **Indicate Willingness to Work**: When submitting a new issue, let us know if
  you're willing to work on a solution.

## Pull Requests

- **Alignment with Project Goals**: Before sending a pull request, ensure your
  contribution aligns with our project's objectives. For significant changes,
  discussing them in an issue beforehand is beneficial. Check our [open pull
  requests] to see if similar work is already in progress.

### Workflow and Versioning

We follow the [GitHub flow] for our versioning workflow.

When you're working on something:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your task.
3. Send a pull request from your branch to our `Main` branch.

### Code and Style Guidelines

- **Coding Standards**: Keep your code neat and consistent with our coding
  standards.
- **Style Guide**: Make sure your pull requests adhere to our [Code Style +
  Standards Guides].
- **Documentation Guidelines**: When you contribute new features or make
  significant changes to the code, please also update the relevant documentation.
  This ensures that the project remains easy to understand and use for all
  contributors and users. Good documentation includes clear explanations,
  examples, and any necessary configuration details.
- **Testing Guidelines**: When submitting code, please ensure it's **well-tested**.
  Include unit, integration, or end-to-end tests where appropriate to cover your
  changes and prevent regressions. If you're adding a new feature, please include
  tests for its functionality. For bug fixes, consider adding a test that
  reproduces the bug before your fix, and then passes after the fix.
  Explain how you've tested your changes in your pull request description. If
  you've run specific commands to test, include them.

### Pull Request Size Guidelines

To streamline the review process and increase the likelihood of your
contributions being accepted quickly, we ask you to break down large changes
into **smaller, logical Pull Requests**.

#### Why Smaller PRs?

- **Faster Reviews**: Smaller PRs are easier to grasp and understand, allowing
  reviewers to provide feedback more quickly.
- **Fewer Errors**: Isolating changes into smaller, focused parts reduces the
  chance of introducing new bugs.
- **Easier Debugging**: If issues arise, it's much simpler to pinpoint the cause
  within a limited set of changes.
- **Smoother Integration**: Small, incremental changes can be integrated into
  the main branch more easily, minimizing conflicts.

#### How to Break Down a Large PR

1. **Identify Logical Units**: Look for parts of your change that can stand
   independently. Think about a new feature, a bug fix, a refactoring of a
   specific component, or a documentation update.
2. **Create Separate Branches**: For each logical unit, create a new branch.
3. **Submit Incremental PRs**: Submit PRs for each individual branch.
   Ensure each PR has a clear, well-defined goal and focuses on a single change.
4. **Reference Related PRs**: If PRs are dependent on each other, reference
   the earlier PR in the description of the subsequent PR (e.g., "This builds
   upon #PR-number").
